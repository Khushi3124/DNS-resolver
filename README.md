# Simple Java DNS Resolver
This project implements a basic DNS resolver program written in Java. It consists of two components: a client and a server.

## Functionality:

- The client takes a hostname as input from the user.
- The client queries the server for the IP address corresponding to the hostname.
- The server interacts with the DNS system to resolve the hostname and retrieve the IP address.
- Upon successful resolution, the server returns the IP address to the client.
- Additionally, the resolved hostname and IP address pair are stored in a text file for future reference.

## Usage:

- Compile the client and server code using a Java compiler.
- Run the server application first.
- Run the client application and provide a hostname as input.
- The client will display the resolved IP address (if successful).
- The resolved hostname and IP address will be appended to the designated text file.

## Benefits:

- Provides a basic understanding of DNS resolution process.
- Demonstrates client-server communication in Java.
- Offers a simple tool for hostname-to-IP address resolution.
